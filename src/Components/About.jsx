              <h5>Who I am</h5>
              <p>
                A passionate Full Stack Developer with 1 years of experience
                building robust web applications. I specialize in the **MERN
                stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and love transforming
                complex problems into elegant solutions.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h5>Education</h5>
              <p>
                I have completed my Pre-University Education (PUC) at Alvas
                Pre-University College, Mangaluru. (2020-2022)
              <br />
                I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science
                Engineering at BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore.
                (2022-2026)

              <h5>Hobbies</h5>
              <p>
                I love to play Chess and badminton. I enjoy reading books and

              <h5>My Development Philosophy</h5>
              <p>I write code that humans can readâ€”clear, maintainable, and well-documented. Obsessed with performance optimization, I relentlessly refine every millisecond out of critical paths. I champion test-driven development (TDD) to build robust systems from the ground up, and I advocate for clean architecture principles to ensure scalable, modular designs that stand the test of time.
